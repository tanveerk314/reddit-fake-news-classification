An overview of posting rules and a welcome to the new Subscribers,"Welcome to /r/TheOnion. I acquired this small little subreddit from RedditRequest quite awhile ago. I hadn't expected this, and before traffic was very low. As such, we don't have many written rules as of right now. The big one is to only post links from The Onion website. Basic posting rules apply, we'll try to remove very little, except for spam of course. All content posted is appreciated! The more the better! This post is short but it's basically just to say welcome. I look forward to seeing the community grow even more!
